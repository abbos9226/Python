Homework:

Exercise 1: Threaded Prime Number Checker

Write a Python program that checks whether a given range of numbers contains prime numbers. Divide the range among multiple threads to parallelize the prime checking process. Each thread should be responsible for checking a subset of the range, and the main program should print the list of prime numbers found.

Exercise 2: Threaded File Processing

Write a program that reads a large text file containing lines of text. Implement a threaded solution to count the occurrence of each word in the file. Each thread should process a portion of the file, and the main program should display a summary of word occurrences across all threads.
